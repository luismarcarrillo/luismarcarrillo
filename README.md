## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Luismar Carrillo, an enthusiastic student of electronic engineering with a deep passion for mathematics and machine learning. My ultimate goal is to become an applied mathematician and scientist, using these powerful tools to solve complex problems across various domains, including finance, climate change, and computer science. Hereâ€™s a bit more about me:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently focused on advancing my knowledge in machine learning and mathematics, applying these techniques to tackle challenges in fields like finance and climate change, all while building a solid foundation in computer science.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m actively learning Python, ML Engineering, and deepening my understanding of mathematics.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m eager to collaborate on open-source projects, especially those that intersect with mathematics, computer science, finance, or climate change.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking to build and contribute to an open-source community centered on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.
